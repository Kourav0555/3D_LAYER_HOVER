# 3D Layer Hover Project

This is a small front-end project I built while learning HTML and CSS  
It’s a simple experiment where I tried to create a 3D layered hover animation using CSS

I’m currently exploring more about animations, transforms, and creative effects in CSS, and this project was a fun way to practice that.  


# What I Learned
- Using transform and transition for smooth animations  
- Positioning elements with absolute and relative  
- Creating depth through layered images  
- Applying gradient backgrounds for visual appeal 

# Tech Used
- HTML5 — to structure the layout  
- CSS3 — for the hover and animation effects
